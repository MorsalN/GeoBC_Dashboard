The result of the deliverables is a working web application that showcases the Digital Road Atlas (DRA) across British Columbia but this image focuses on the Kamloops regions to showcase the changes that have been done on each of the roads in each month. Each month had some road sections that have been modified and included the previous road sections as well but our task was to take only the changes made in each monthâ€™s dataset and export all the changes of every month into a new dataset. The new target dataset that consisted of all the changes was then exported to ArcGIS Online for the web application to be made. The web application consists of a time slider where the user can select which time range they want to see changes in the DRA. At the top right of the web application, dependent on what time range the client or user selected, it will show the amount of changes that were made in that time period. When clicking on the polylines of the DRA, a pop up window will appear that will give the user more information on that particular section that was edited in that time period.
